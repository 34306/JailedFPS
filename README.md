### This tweak is based on [FPSIndicator](https://github.com/brendonjkding/FPSIndicator) by [brendonjkding](https://github.com/brendonjkding)
### I just modified tweak.xm to make it can injected to iPA.
- The Yellow text show 79.9 is exactly FPS, the below is CPU-X, I tested on Genshin Impact and CPU-X not show exactly FPS as JailedFPS does, so I recommend you should use JailedFPS for exactly FPS.
